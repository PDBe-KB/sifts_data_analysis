# sifts_data_analysis
Google Colab notebook for accessing up-to-date SIFTS annotations from PDBx/mmCIF files. 

## Getting started
This notebook provides information on how to parse, extract and filter SIFTS annotations from the updated PDBx/mmCIF files. Additionally, the notebook demonstrates how users can compare various numbering schemes of a given residue across different PDB structures of the same protein.

Open the sifts.ipynb file to see the Jupyter Notebook or click on <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/PDBe-KB/sifts_data_analysis/blob/main/sifts.ipynb" target="_blank">sifts.ipynb</a> to directly  open this notebook in Google Colab.
